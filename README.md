# Full Stack Development Assignments â€” Problem Statement

This repository contains the **official problem statement** for two structured web development assignments designed to evaluate end-to-end proficiency in **C# (.NET 8)** and **React with TypeScript**.

Each assignment focuses on both **frontend** and **backend** development and is meant to simulate real-world development tasks involving REST APIs, user authentication, and UI state management.

- Use **React (TypeScript)** for frontend
- Implement **REST API** using **.NET 8 Core**
- Use **in-memory storage**

**Enhancements (Optional):**

- Task filters (All / Completed / Active)
- Responsive UI using Bootstrap or Tailwind
- Persist tasks in `localStorage`

### ðŸ’¼ Home Assignment 2 â€“ Mini Project Manager

**Objective:**  
Build a **modular, full-stack project management system** with authentication, multi-entity relationships, and a responsive frontend.

**Business Context:**  
Users can register, log in, create multiple projects, and manage tasks within each project.

**Core Features:**

- **Authentication:** JWT-based registration & login
- **Projects:** CRUD operations with ownership restrictions
- **Tasks:** Manage tasks linked to projects
- **Frontend:** SPA built using React with routing & state management

**Backend Requirements:**

- REST API using **.NET 8 Core** + **Entity Framework Core**
- Use **SQLite** or in-memory database
- Implement structured architecture (DTOs, services, models)

**Frontend Requirements:**

- Built with **React + TypeScript**
- Pages: Login, Register, Dashboard, Project Details
- Form validation and API integration via Axios
- Store JWT for authenticated requests
- Navigation using **React Router**

**Enhancements:**

- Smart Scheduler API (`POST /api/v1/projects/{projectId}/schedule`)
- Loading indicators and animations
- Mobile-friendly, responsive design
- Deployed frontend on **Vercel**, backend on **Render**

**Solution Repositories:**
